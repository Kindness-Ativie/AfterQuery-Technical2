Response to AfterQuery-Technical2

First receive input of s1 and s2. Find mimimum (smallest length) word by utilzing length built-in. Count bulls by staring at index 0 of minimum word and comparing to corresponding index to comparison word (largest length). Count cows by removing duplicate characters of comparison word and using built in "in" to increase cow count if the character exists in minimum word.
